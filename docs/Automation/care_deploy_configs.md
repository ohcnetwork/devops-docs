## `test.yml`

The `test.yml` workflow performs the following tasks:

1. **Checkout Code**:
   - Retrieves the latest code from the repository to ensure that the workflow operates on the most recent version.

2. **Setup Node.js Environment**:
   - Configures the Node.js environment to ensure that the correct version of Node.js is used.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Installs the project's dependencies from `package-lock.json` to ensure that all required packages are available.

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Executes the test suite to validate the project's functionality and confirm that no issues have been introduced.

5. **Ensure CI Environment**:
   - Runs the tests in continuous integration mode to adapt to the CI environment's requirements.

### Breakdown:

1. **Checkout Code**:
   - Uses `actions/checkout@v2.6.0` to pull the latest code from the repository.

2. **Setup Node.js Environment**:
   - Uses `actions/setup-node@v3.5.1` to set up the appropriate Node.js version.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies as specified in `package-lock.json`.

4. **Run Tests**:
   - Executes `npm test` to run the project's test suite with `CI: true` to ensure compatibility with the CI environment.

This workflow ensures that code changes are validated through tests and that the environment is correctly configured for reliable and consistent results.
