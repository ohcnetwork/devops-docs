# Wireguard VPN

Using [wg-easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/) VPN can be setup that also comes with a web UI to manage users and connections. Access to services including kubernetes endpoints can be restricted and secured by adding the IP address of the instance in which wireguard is deployed. Connections can be made to the services only when connected via VPN.  

## Deployment 

This is an example on how to use WireGuard Easy with nginx, to access it on a HTTPS domain (e.g. `https://wg-easy.myhomelab.com`).

## `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  wg-easy:
    environment:
      # ⚠️ Change the server's hostname (clients will connect to):
      - WG_HOST=wg-easy.myhomelab.com

      # ⚠️ Change the Web UI Password:
      - PASSWORD=foobar123
    image: ghcr.io/wg-easy/wg-easy
    container_name: wg-easy
    hostname: wg-easy
    volumes:
      - ~/.wg-easy:/etc/wireguard
    ports:
      - "51820:51820/udp"
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
      - SYS_MODULE
    sysctls:
      - net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
      - net.ipv4.conf.all.src_valid_mark=1

  nginx:
    image: weejewel/nginx-with-certbot
    container_name: nginx
    hostname: nginx
    volumes:
      - ~/.nginx/servers/:/etc/nginx/servers/
      - ./.nginx/letsencrypt/:/etc/letsencrypt/
    ports:
      - "80:80/tcp"
      - "443:443/tcp"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## `~/.nginx/servers/wg-easy.conf`:

```
server {
    server_name ⚠️wg-easy.myhomelab.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://wg-easy:51821/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```

Save these files, edit the variables marked with `⚠️` and run `docker-compose up -d` in the same directory.

Then run once:

```bash
$ docker exec -it nginx /bin/sh
$ cp /etc/nginx/servers/wg-easy.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/.
$ certbot --nginx --non-interactive --agree-tos -m webmaster@google.com -d ⚠️wg-easy.myhomelab.com
$ nginx -s reload
$ exit
```

Of course, make sure to point `wg-easy.myhomelab.com` to your server's IP address with a DNS A record or DynamicDNS or any other method. Ensure ports `80`, `443`, `51820` are available (e.g. by forwarding them in your router).
